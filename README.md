## 🌟 Overview

**Form a Bunch** is a social media–style communication platform designed to empower workers and unions by improving transparency, collaboration, and organization.  
It bridges the gap between employees and union representatives, making it easier to **form**, **join**, and **engage** with unions.

Our mission is simple: make labor organization as easy and accessible as creating a group chat.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Across many industries, workers face significant challenges in organizing and communicating effectively.  
From factories to farms, many employees lack access to centralized platforms where they can safely discuss workplace conditions, share updates, and connect with unions that represent them.  

This communication gap weakens labor solidarity, slows down the process of forming unions, and often leaves workers unaware of their rights or the resources available to them.  
During our research, we were particularly inspired by stories of **banana plantation workers who were overworked and isolated**, unable to effectively communicate across departments or reach out to labor representatives. Their situation sparked our goal: **to create a simple, secure platform where every worker’s voice can be heard.**

## 🧠 Inspiration

Our idea was inspired by the struggles of **banana plantation workers** who lacked the means to collectively voice their concerns or organize due to poor communication channels.  
Their resilience and need for unity motivated our team to create a tool that would make forming unions as effortless as forming friendships online.
